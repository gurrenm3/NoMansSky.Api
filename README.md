# NMS Lib
A C# modding API for the game No Mans Sky.
Built with [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project), an extremely powerful set of modding tools.

**IMPORTANT:**
This project is a work in progress and will likely have breaking changes in the future.

## What is this project?
This project is an API mod for No Mans Sky. It's intended to help mod makers build crazy powerful mods. Essentially, this project uses memory modding techniques to expose NMS to a C# API that other modders can use.

## Planned features
Some features that are coming soon are:

- Modify any of the player's stats
- Manipulate items and inventories
- Custom items
- More than 3 multi-tools
- More than 1 freighter
